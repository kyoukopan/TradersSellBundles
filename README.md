# Traders Sell Bundles mod ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/SPT-3.9.8-white?style=flat&labelColor=blue)

For **SPT 3.9.8**

This BepInEx client mod allows filled containers to be added to a trader's inventory. For example, you can add a duffle bag that comes with supplies inside.

The default client behavior rejects any containers with items inside, causing them to be unpurchasable and greyed out. This mod enables the price to be fetched and the item to display properly.

***Note:* This mod does not add any items to trader inventories on its own!** You will need to add the items using another mod.

### Installation

1. Download the *.zip file from https://github.com/kyoukopan/TradersSellBundles/releases
2. Place the BepInEx folder inside your SPT directory
3. Install a mod that adds containers with items in them to a trader's assort

### Issues

This is my first mod, so there might be bugs. I haven't tested it extensively yet, but will continue to test it moving forward.
